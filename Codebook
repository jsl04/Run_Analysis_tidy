Codebook for the tidying of accelerometer application data

Raw data came from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Here is a list of all the datasets used:
-X.train.txt
-subject_train.txt
-y_train.txt
-subject_test.txt
-X_test.txt
-y_test.txt
-features.txt


The descriptive labels are all contained in the features.txt file, I assigned the labels to a data frame that had the columns of main data(all train and test files) merged together.

I then took the subject file and manually assigned them to their proper subject.

After the above, a new data set was created.
